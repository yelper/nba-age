# nba-age
Visualizations of players' ages in the NBA.  Just done for fun to try out a beeswarm plot with D3 v4.  A [reference bl.ock of a beeswarm is here](https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/6526445e2b44303eebf21da3b6627320).

### Installation

To build the code, type `tsc` in console within this directory.  If you do not have TypeScript installed on your computer, install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), then type `npm install -g typescript` from a console.  

If you want D3 typings for the TypeScript code, type `npm install @types/d3` and restart your IDE.
